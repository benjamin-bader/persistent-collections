I learn tons by re-implementing things, so this is my adaptation of Clojure's persistent data structures to Kotlin.  Credit to Rich Hickey, Christophe Grande, et al; mistakes are mine.

The goal of this repo is to learn, and to produce a well-documented set of code that helps me (and others) remember how these things work.
